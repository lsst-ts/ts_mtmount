"""A simple command-line script that sends commands to
the low-level controller (Operation Manager).

Must be connected to a low-level port on the Operation Manger.
At this time the only available port is for the hand-held device,
but Tekniker plans to make an additional port available for our CSC.

Warning: this should not be used while the CSC is running.
